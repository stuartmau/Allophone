### About

Each standalone page has a list of about 300 short simple common English words.

Images courtesy of unsplash.com using two random words from the list. The words list has been trimmed to remove suggestive or gendered terms to reduce the frequency of girls in bikinis which fortunately and unfortunately increases and decreases the breadth of topics displayed.

### Use

Download and open in your browser. No server required. Reload or click the page to refresh.

Words and images are chosen at random with replacement. Occasionally Unsplash will not find an image for the pair of chosen words.

### Customise

Each page has an embedded word list. Add or remove with a text editor. No frameworks or libraries are used.

The text sizes are not formatted for landscape or small screens. Tweak the text size the style tag.

Versions with transparent background are provided for use with [OBS Studio BrowserSource](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Sources-Guide#browsersource).
